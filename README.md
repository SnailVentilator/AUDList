Attention: There is also a marketing document available [here](https://gitlab.com/snailventilator/audList/blob/master/MARKETING.md)!

## Included in this repository
- Automatic measurement and generation of a graph (ideally) showing the runtime of the 4 lists
- Unit tests to verify that the non-java lists behave the same as the java lists

## Graphs

![Add Graph][add]
![Contains Graph][contains]
![Remove by Index][removeByIndex]
![Remvoe by Value][removeByValue]
